Description
This project explores Financial Sentiment Analysis (FSA) using LLMs like BERT, FinBERT, and GPT-4 to analyze sentiment in financial texts such as news, reports, and announcements. It leverages prompt engineering, zero-shot, and few-shot learning to improve sentiment classification accuracy with minimal training.

Features
âœ… Sentiment classification of financial texts
âœ… Zero-shot & few-shot learning for better adaptability
âœ… Comparison of LLMs vs. traditional models
âœ… Data processing & visualization

Technologies Used
Machine Learning Models: BERT, FinBERT, GPT-4

Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Scikit-learn

Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
